\title{Impute speeds}
\usage{
impute_speeds(session_data, from_distances = TRUE, lgap = 30, lskip = 5,
  m = 11, sport = "cycling", units = NULL)

imputeSpeeds(session_data, from_distances = TRUE, lgap = 30, lskip = 5,
  m = 11, sport = "cycling", units = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{session_data}{A multivariate \code{\link[zoo]{zoo}} object with
observations of either distance or speed (named Distance or Speed,
respectively).}

\item{from_distances}{Logical. Should the speeds be calculated from the distance recordings
instead of taken from the speed recordings directly?}

\item{lgap}{Time in seconds corresponding to the minimal sampling rate.}

\item{lskip}{Time in seconds between the last observation before a small break
and the first imputed speed or the last imputed speed and the first
observation after a small break.}

\item{m}{Number of imputed observations in each small break.}

\item{sport}{What sport does \code{sessions_data} contain data of? Either
\code{'cycling'} (default), \code{'running'}, \code{'swimming'}.}

\item{units}{Units of measurement.}
}
\value{
A multivariate \code{\link[zoo]{zoo}} object with imputed observations:
    0 for speed, last known position for latitude, longitude and altitude,
    NA for all other variables. Distances are calculated based on speeds after imputation.
}
\description{
Impute speeds of 0 during small breaks within a session.
