\usage{
get_elevation_gain(object, smooth = FALSE, cumulative = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A (univariate) zoo object.}

\item{smooth}{Logical. Should the elevation be
smoothed? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cumulative}{Logical. Return the cumulative elevation gain
(\code{FALSE}; default) or just the elevation gain?}
}
\description{
(Cumulative) Elevation gain.
}
\details{
The elevation gain is defined here as the difference in altitude
between two consecutive observations. If \code{cumulative = FALSE}
then the elevation gain is returned, otherwise any elevation loses
(i.e. negative elevation gain) are ignored and the cumulative
elevation gain is returned. If \code{smooth = TRUE} then the
elevation gain will be smoothed using a spline smoother before
either returning it or computing cumulative elevation gains.
