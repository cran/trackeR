* To do
+ [X] Speed up summary
+ [ ] Speed up smoothing of concentration profiles
  Refactor code to compute concentration profiles first and integrate those for distribution profiles

  Leave the observed distribution profiles as they are but their value
  at zero needs to match the integral of the concentration profile
  exactly (session_duration)!

+ [ ] cli support for session summaries
+ [ ] Add art
+ [X] Parallel infrastructure
+ [X] Add session_duration and session_times for trackeRdata
+ [X] Add session_duration and session_times for trackeRdataSummary
+ [X] Add multi-sport support
+ [-] rename readContainer to readWorkout
  No...

+ [X] add _ alternatives to camel case

+ [X] Multi-sport support to trackeRdata methods
+ [X] Units of cadence when there are cycling, running and
  swimming sessions in the same object

  Leave as is for now.... Need to rethink of this

+ [X] Add parallel support to readDirectory
+ [X] Update parallel computations using the foreach structure
+ [ ] save a fitted model into memory for classification

+ [X] Take care of things that depend on cycling in a multi-sport environment

+ [ ] Update README

+ [X] Remove redundant data sets
+ [ ] make sure all examples work!

+ [X] Turn threshold into a method
+ [X] Handling NA sports?
+ [- ] Rename sessionStart, sessionEnd in session times
+ [- ] Rename summary variables to underscore names (avg_cadence)
+ [- ] add set_sport(); set_sport(object, session, sport)
+ [X] leafletRoute,
+ [X] ridges
+ [X] change_units.trackeRdataZones
+ [X] plot.trackeRdataZones (unit_reference_sport)
+ [X] Add a sport option in zones or leave it to be chosen by sessions?
+ [ ] Add fast cp method for trackeRdata objects
+ [ ] Remove auto_grid from zones
+ [ ] Wprime


+ [ ] Changed:

  - restingPeriods -> get_resting_periods
  - correctDistances -> correct_distances
  - fromDistances -> from_distances
  - imputeSpeeds -> impute_speeds
  - sport -> get_sport
  - leafletRoute -> leaflet_route
  - plotRoute -> plot_route
  - in summary movingThreshold to moving_threshold
  - xProfile -> x_profile
  - function change_units in shiny needs a different name

+ [X] implement unique units in summary method! Need a function that
  takes a units object and results in a df with unique variables

+ [X] Write tests for summary
+ [X] plot trackeRdata
+ [X] concentration/distribution profiles
  scale? no need for append and c. for profiles...
+ [X] Also simplify plot for concentration prof as for distribution prof
+ [X] plot summary
+ [X] Add object specifications in help files
+ [X] warnings start with lower case
